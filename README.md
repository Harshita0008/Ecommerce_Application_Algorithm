Algorithms E-commerce application project built during Microsoft Engage 2022 program.

# 1.  About the Project

##  => <a name='E-commerceApplication:'></a>E-commerce Application :
   - The application is made using dart Flutter.
   - This application can be used on both android and ios devices.
   - It is a product based shopping app including fashion items and gadgets.
   - The app contains 11+ screens with an enriching user interface.

##  => <a name='AlogorithmUsed'></a>Alogorithm Used

   - Based on the interest of a user by collecting prefrences, information and evaluation of past behaviour i.e "Collabrative Filtering".
   - Using the cosine similarity to measure the similarity between the pair of vectors.
   - Recommend items that are similar to the user's highly preferred items.

DEMYSTIFYING THE THREE PHASES OF PROJECT 

#### - Phase-1 (May 9):
 The goal in this phase is project initiation planning, researching and designing - choosing ALGORITHMS project among three projects looking at the goals and project scope. Researching about app category to implement and execute recommendation engine. Designing accessible, consistent and basic UI/UX of the application including the functionalities and desiginations. I search for tutorials, chosen across platforms app development i.e. FLUTTER which supports DART as programming language.

#### - Phase-2 (May 16):
 In the mid phase, built actionable and visual appealing features - Started the development process by taking help from my mentor and internet resources. Added significant dependencies and packages which supported app accordingly. Made required changes as per the UI and structure to make it more attractive.

#### - Phase-3 (May 26):
 This is the final phase of the project management process - Monitoring the critical success factors and key performance indicators. To get better performance matrix wherever applicable. My detailed research made it easy and exciting for me decide how to implement the surprise adapt feature. Decided to build my app using DART and HTML because that reduces app crashes. The final go through included matrics such as execution time, memory consumption, CPU utilization, overall throughput and response time. Some features in the application are clickable and some of them are UI for showcasing the overall protocol of any real world app.


# 3. Getting Started
##   <a name='Prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Version and Sdk environment should be

    version: 1.0.0+1
    
    environment:sdk: '>=2.12.0 <3.0.0'

Make sure to add SVG dependencies which willhelp us to use SVG in our app

    flutter_svg: ^0.22.0

To Run the application 

    Press F5 and run the application on window. We can resize the window to view the app in form of android phones. 

# 4. Challenges Faced and Overcoming them
- #### Problem: 
    Encountered with the problem of pixels and renderflex owerflowing.
    #### Solution: 
    Managed relevant packages and wrapping coloumn in a flexible widget in substitution of flex factor.

- #### Problem:
    Icons dimensions were not symmetrical.
    #### Solution:
    Resizing and converting images into Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Format.

- #### Problem: 
    Memory consumption

    #### Solution:
    To reduce the memory consumption, removed unused importing of libraries and simplified the code.
